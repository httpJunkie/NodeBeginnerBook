          <div class="post-content">
            <p>Web browsers and web servers talk to each other over the Internet. It is the client - the browser - which initiates the
exchange. What triggers a browser to do so is the user who enters a URL into the address bar, for example:
<code>http://www.example.com</code>.</p>

<p>The Internet is a network of millions of servers distributed all over the world. One of this million of servers serves
the <em>www.example.com</em> website. How does your browser connect to exactly this one server?</p>

<p>The first thing the browser needs to do to in its quest to find the right server is to translate the domain name you
gave it - <em>www.example.com</em> - into an actual Internet address, which is a number, not a name.</p>

<p>To do so, the browser utilizes an Internet component which is not a part of the World Wide Web itself, but plays a
crucial role in making it more comfortable to use: the Domain Name System, or DNS.</p>

<p>You can think of the DNS as a huge telephone book. You know the name of a person, and you use it to look up their
telephone number. The DNS offers the same service for browsers - the browser queries the DNS with a domain name like
<em>www.example.com</em>, and the DNS tells the browser the Internet address.</p>

<p>You can also query the Domain Name System yourself, from the command line of your virtual Linux box.</p>

<p>To get to a command line, you need to start a Terminal application. To do so, simply click on the Ubuntu symbol in the
upper left corner of your Linux desktop. In the search dialogue which opens, type <em>terminal</em>.</p>

<p>You will get a list of three or four applications as the search result - simply click on the first result which is
name &ldquo;Terminal&rdquo;, the one with the black and white icon of a window with a <em>&gt;_</em> symbol in it.</p>

<p>A new application window opens which provides a text-based interface - a command line.</p>

<p>At the so-called prompt, which probably looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>﻿yourname@ubuntu:~$
</code></pre>

<p>you are able to type commands which the Linux system then executes.</p>

<p>One of this commands is called <em>dig</em>. We can use dig to ask the Domain Name System for the Internet address of
<em>www.example.com</em> like so:</p>

<pre><code>﻿yourname@ubuntu:~$ dig www.example.com A
</code></pre>

<p>Enter this command, and then hit enter. With this, you start the command line application <em>dig</em> with two parameters: the
name for which to look up information from the DNS, and the type of information you want to look up, in this case <em>A</em>,
which stands for <em>Internet Protocol address version 4</em>, or <em>IPv4 address</em>, or, as version 4 is still the predominant
Internet Protocol version, simply <em>IP address</em>.</p>

<p>As a result, your terminal window will output a text block similar to this one:</p>

<pre><code>; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.10.3-P4-Ubuntu &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; www.example.com A
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 51563
;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 1

;; OPT PSEUDOSECTION:
; EDNS: version: 0, flags:; udp: 4096
;; QUESTION SECTION:
;www.example.com.       IN  A

;; ANSWER SECTION:
www.example.com.    7157    IN  A   93.184.216.34

;; Query time: 12 msec
;; SERVER: 127.0.1.1#53(127.0.1.1)
;; WHEN: Tue May 30 08:30:17 CEST 2017
;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 60
</code></pre>

<p>While there is a lot of additional information here which we will ignore for now, we also get the information we asked
for, on line 13: The IPv4 address of www.example.com is <em>93.184.216.34</em>.</p>

<p>When you ask your browser to open <em>www.example.com</em>, it does the same - it tries to retrieve this numeric address via
the DNS.</p>

<p>It doesn&rsquo;t start the <em>dig</em> command in the background - that command is for human users. Instead, it issues the query
directly, using its own program code. The details of this do not matter to us.</p>

<p>You can sometimes even see the browser doing this step - especially if your internet connection is not the fastest, you
can see for a brief moment a status message in the lower left corner of the browser window, stating something similar to
&ldquo;Looking up www.example.com&hellip;&rdquo;.</p>

<p>So, you have entered the address <em>www.example.com</em> into the address bar of your browser, you hit enter, and your browser
uses the Domain Name System to look up the IP address of the server system which serves the <em>www.example.com</em> website.</p>

<h2 id="how-computers-on-the-internet-establish-a-network-connection">How computers on the Internet establish a network connection</h2>

<p>What happens next?</p>

<p>Using the IP address it looked up, the browser can now attempt to establish a network connection to the target server.</p>

<p>To do so, the browser uses the mechanisms of the Internet Protocol, whose job is to make network connections between
computer systems possible. The most important mechanism for this is called <em>routing</em>. Routing is the process of creating
a path between a source node on the Internet (your computer) and a target node on the Internet (the computer system with
IP address <em>93.184.216.34</em>, in our example).</p>

<p>The beauty of this routing mechanism is that while your computer needs to know the exact target address it wants to talk
to, it doesn&rsquo;t need to bother how to get its data to this target address.</p>

<p>Again, a metaphor from real life comes to mind.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s assume you want to write a letter to, say, the <em>European Organization for Nuclear Research</em> in Switzerland, also
known as <em>CERN</em>. In order to do so, you need a target postal address, and you need to know the next post station where
you can mail the letter - and nothing more. The postal system takes care of the rest, and the exact route of the letter
and the intermediary post stations involved is neither known to you nor important to you. You can rest assured that the
system will route your letter correctly to its destination.</p>

<p>With Internet Protocol routing, it&rsquo;s the same: Your computer knows the target address, plus it knows the address of its
own &ldquo;next&rdquo; Internet &ldquo;station&rdquo; - this is called the <em>default gateway</em>. When you connect your computer to the Wifi box in
your home, the IP address of the Wifi box becomes the default gateway of your computer, and a server system from your
Internet provider is in turn the default gateway of your Wifi box.</p>

<p>By delivering data to this default gateway, the data packet starts to travel through the Internet towards its
destination through many different systems - or &ldquo;nodes&rdquo; - on the Internet, bringing it closer to its target with each
step.</p>

<p>Each node simply handing over the data packet to its one &ldquo;next&rdquo; node of course isn&rsquo;t enough, because that would
only work if all nodes, including your source and target node, were connected serially on the Internet. But the Internet
is a network of many nodes interconnected with each other.</p>

<p>Thus, for routing to be useful, several nodes on the Internet have <em>multiple</em> &ldquo;next nodes&rdquo; configured, and depending
on the IP address of the target system, will decide to route the data packet in one direction or the other:</p>

<pre><code>                                                                   NodeJ  
                                                                    ^     
                                                                   /      
                                                                  /       
                             NodeC  --&gt;  NodeG  --&gt;  NodeI  --&gt;  NodeK
                              ^            \                                 
                             /              \                                
                            /                \                               
                           /                  v                              
Source  --&gt;  NodeA  --&gt;  NodeB              NodeH                           
                          /\
                         /  \
                        /    \
                       v      \
                     NodeD     v
                             NodeE  --&gt;  Target
                                         (93.184.216.34)
</code></pre>

<p>The above diagram is meant to be a very simplified illustration of the logical structure of a very tiny part of the
Internet.</p>

<p>The <em>Source</em> node could be your computer, which has <em>NodeA</em> (probably your DSL router) as its default gateway. When
your computer tries to reach the node with IP 93.184.216.34, it has no choice but to hand over data to the only node it
knows, <em>NodeA</em>. NodeA also only has one default gateway (probably a system operated by your Internet provider), <em>NodeB</em>.</p>

<p><em>NodeB</em>, however, has routes to multiple other nodes, <em>NodeC</em>, <em>NodeD</em> and <em>NodeE</em>, and it also knows which of these
nodes is the best next hop for a data packet addressed to <em>93.184.216.34</em>.</p>

<p><em>NodeE</em>, then, has a direct route to the target node, and can deliver the data packet.</p>

<p>Thus, <em>Source -&gt; A -&gt; B -&gt; E -&gt; Target</em> is the route over which your computer and the target system can establish a
connection.</p>

<p>This routing capability is the foundation of the Internet - it allows two computer systems to exchange data with each
other.</p>

<h2 id="how-computer-programs-talk-to-each-other-over-the-internet">How computer programs talk to each other over the Internet</h2>

<p>By now, we have established a general understanding of how computers find other computers on the Internet, and how they
can establish a network connection via IP addresses and data packet routing using these addresses.</p>

<p>We now need to zoom in even closer, and have a look at how exactly data is exchanged between a client and a server.</p>

<p>First of all, it&rsquo;s important to note that it is not <em>computers</em> which exchange data through the Internet, it is
<em>applications</em> which do.</p>

<p>Our computers are just the physical shell in which our applications live, providing the physical means like network
cards and network cables (or radio signals) which enable remote applications to talk to each other.</p>

<p>In our case, the two applications talking to each other are the web browser application and the web server application.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s update a diagram we have used before with more details:</p>

<p>As you can see, the word <em>server</em> is used ambigously: it can mean the physical machine - the <em>hardware</em> - which is
connected to a network like the Internet in order to <em>serve</em> data (e.g. a web server for web pages, a file server for
files, a mail server for mails), but it can also mean the application - the <em>software</em> - which does the serving of web
pages, files, or mails.</p>

<p>To distinguish between these two, I&rsquo;m more precise in this text: I will talk about the server <em>application</em> when talking
about the piece of software which serves web pages, and about the server <em>system</em> when talking about the computer which
runs the server application.</p>

<p>The Internet mechanisms we have seen so far - DNS, IP addressing, and routing - are sufficient to establish a network
connection between two computer systems, but not for making their applications talk to each other. If that was the case</p>

<h2 id="how-web-browsers-and-web-servers-talk-to-each-other">How web browsers and web servers talk to each other</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s zoom even further in. We have learned how your web browser is able to find the IP address of the web server it
wants to request using the Domain Name System, and we have learned how your web browser can establish a connection to
the web server system available under this IP address using the routing mechanisms of the Internet.</p>

<p>Now that a connection is established, we will have a look at the actual data exchange.</p>
